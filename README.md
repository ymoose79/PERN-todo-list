## PERN todo list

This was an older project I did utilizing the PERN stack.  I'm not super familiar with sql db's.  I'm sure this is taken from a tutorial, however, I can't rightly give credit where credit's due as I don't remember where I found this one. (I'm guessing Traversey Media, but, again...)
